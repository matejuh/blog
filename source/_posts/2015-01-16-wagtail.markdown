I wanted to learn some simple language to be able create quickly web sites. I don't like PHP, so I decided to learn Python.

Last couple of days I was playing with Django. I wanted to create web site with user pages and some blog posts visible only to logged users.

I went through all bigger Django CMS demos and choose [Wagtail](http://wagtail.io/). It's very powerful for web development, but unfortunately it is still young project
and anyway as other Django CMS does not have sufficient user customization and permissions model.
